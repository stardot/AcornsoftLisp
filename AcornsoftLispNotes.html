    <h1>Notes on the Acornsoft Lisp interpreter</h1>
    
    <p>The Acornsoft Lisp Interpreter was produced for the BBC
      Microcomputer in the early 1980s.  It was adapted from a Lisp
      written for the Apple II by Owl Computers.</p>

    <p>It is a very small, dynamically-scoped Lisp written in 6502
      assembler.  Versions were sold on cassette and floppy disk, but
      the version discussed here is the one distributed as a ROM.</p>
    
    <h2>Object types</h2>
    
    <p>There are five types of object - symbol, number, subr, fsubr,
      and cons.  Each contains a type field as its first byte.</p>

    <table>
      <tr class="bytes"><th>Byte:</th><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td>
	<td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>...</td></tr>
      <tr class="object">
	<th>symbol</th>
	<td>CHARF (0x00)</td>
	<td>length</td>
	<td colspan="2">value</td>
	<td colspan="2">property list</td>
	<td colspan="3">name ...</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="object">
	<th>number</th>
	<td>NUMF (0x04)</td>
	<td>length (4)</td>
	<td colspan="2">value</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="object">
	<th>subr</th>
	<td>SUBRF (0x08)</td>
	<td>min args</td>
	<td colspan="2">unused</td>
	<td colspan="2">function</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="object">
	<th>fsubr</th>
	<td>FSUBRF (0x0c)</td>
	<td>min args</td>
	<td colspan="2">unused</td>
	<td colspan="2">function</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="object">
	<th>cons</th>
	<td>LISTF (0x80)</td>
	<td colspan="2">car</td>
	<td colspan="2">cdr</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
      
    <p>Symbols (referred to in the code as "character atoms") contain
      a pointer to their value and property list.  They are
      variable-length, with the name of the symbol at the end.  The
      length field gives the length of the whole object, six plus the
      length of the name. There are no undefined symbols, but their
      initial value is a symbol named UNDEFINED.  The property lists
      of symbols are in fact a-lists, not p-lists.  Symbols are
      interned by traversing the entire heap looking for an existing
      symbol with the right name.</p>

    <p>Numbers are 16 bit integers.  The length field seems unnecessary as
      it is always four, but the code appears to envisage the
      possibility of larger number objects.</p>

    <p>Subrs and fsubrs represent built-in functions and contain the
      address of the assembler code that implements them.  They can
      also contain what appears to be a pointer to a list of default
      arguments.  There is code in eval (and the garbage collector) to
      handle this, but none of the built-in functions use it.</p>

    <p>Conses contain (of course) pointers to their car and cdr.
      The type code of 0x80 (-128) allows their type to be tested
      by a single BMI (branch if minus) instruction.</p>

    <p>The type codes are all multiples of four.  The two low order
      bits are used to mark objects during garbage collection.</p>

    <p>In addition to these five types there is also the value NIL,
      which is represented by a zero pointer, or rather by any pointer
      whose high byte is zero.  This makes it easy to test for NIL,
      but on the other hand requires that pointers be tested for NIL
      before dereferencing, in particular before looking at their
      type field.  There is also a symbol with the name NIL, but any
      attempt to intern the name "NIL" returns a NIL pointer instead.</p>

    <p>Objects are usually addressed through a pointer in zero page
      indexed by the y-register to access their fields.</p>
    
    <p>There is no string type.  Unreferenced symbols whose value is
      UNDEFINED and whose property list is NIL will be garbage
      collected, so they can safely be used for this purpose.  Because
      objects are limited in size to 255 bytes, the longest symbol
      name possible is 249 characters.</p>

    <h2>Memory Use</h2>

    <h3>Zero page</h3>
    
    The interpreter stores numerous variables in zero page, most
    importantly an area called TVS.  TVS presumably stands for
    something like "temporary variable space".  It is the area that is
    pushed onto the stack when when a function is called. TVS starts
    at address 0x0030.  The variables in TVS (all 16-bit pointers
    unless specified) are:

    <dl>
      <dt>ARG (TVS+0x00)</dt>
      <dd>This variable is central to the read-eval-print loop.
	The interpreter function READ returns its value in ARG,
	EVAL evaluates the expression in ARG and puts the result
	in ARG, and PRINT prints the value in ARG.</dd>

      <dt>BINDER (TVS+0x02)</dt>
      <dd>This single byte location is always zero.  It exists
	for convenience when pushing a stack frame (see below).</dd>

      <dt>TVSEXT (TVS+0x03)</dt>
      <dd>This single byte location contains the size of the active
	part of TVS.  It is always at least 10 (0x0a) and increases
	when arguments are present.</dd>

      <dt>WSA (TVS+0x04), WSB (TVS+0x06), WSC (TVS+0x08)</dt>
      <dd>These three "workspace" variables are used for various
	purposes.  Because they are within TVS, they are saved on
	the stack when a function is called, so they can be used
	for values that need to survive across function calls.</dd>

      <dt>ARGA (TVS+0x0a), ARGB (TVS+0x0c), ...</dt>
      <dd>When a function is called, its evaluated arguments are
	placed here.  The first 5 are named ARGA ... ARGE, but up to
	28 arguments are allowed.  The number present can be deduced
	from TVSEXT.</dd>
	
    </dl>

    <p>Other variables in zero page include the stack pointer (SP) and
      a fourth workspace variable WSD which is not saved on the stack.
      Locations at the end of page zero are reserved for the operating
      system.</p>
      
    <h3>Page 1</h3>

    <p>Page 1 is the 6502 hardware stack.  It is not used for the
      the Lisp function stack, as it is much too small.  It is used
      for function calls within the interpreter itself, and for
      garbage collection (see below).</p>

    <h3>Other variables and buffers</h3>

    <p>Several less heavily used variables are stored in page 4,
      including VECBOT and IMBOT (see below).  Pages 6 and 7 are used
      for I/O buffers.</p>

    <h3>Vectors for built-in functions</h3>

    <p>Subrs and fsubrs do not directly call the assembly language
      functions that implement them.  Instead they are vectored
      through a table of JMP instructions stored immediately below the
      heap.  This is so that saved images do not depend on a
      particular version of the interpreter (see saved images
      below).  The jump table occupies two pages of memory, and is
      copied into RAM from the ROM when Lisp starts.  Its start
      address depends on OSHWM, the Operating System High-Water Mark,
      but is always on a page boundary, two pages before the start of
      the heap.  The high-order byte of its address is stored in
      the variable VECBOT.</p>

    <h3>The heap</h3>
    
    <p>All Lisp objects are stored on the heap.  It grows upwards from
      from the page boundary following the vectors.  The high-order
      byte of its address is stored in the variable IMBOT, and the
      address of the first free byte above the heap is stored in the
      variable AREVAL.  The initial heap image is copied from the
      ROM.</p>
    <p>Objects are stored consecutively in the heap without regard to
      type.  New objects are allocated at the top of the heap.  As the
      6502 has no alignment restrictions there is no unused space
      between objects; the heap can be traversed by starting from the
      first object, then adding its length to get the second one, and
      so on.</p>

    <h3>The stack</h3>
    
    <p>The stack grows downwards from the top of available memory,
      which is obtained from the operating system and stored in a
      variable called ARETOP.  Its value depends on the
      current graphics mode.  (The graphics mode can be changed, but
      changes do not take effect until the interpreter returns to its
      top level, so that the top of the stack can be changed.)</p>
    <p>The stack contains saved variables from TVS, return addresses,
      and variable bindings to be undone when a function returns
      (shallow binding).  A stack frame looks like this (higher
      addresses at the top):</p>

    <table border="1px">
      <tr><td>ARETOP</td></tr>
      <tr><td>(next frame)</td><td>...</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>ARG</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>return address</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>ARGn</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>...</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>ARGA</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>WSC</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>WSB</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>WSA</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>size of frame (= number of arguments * 2 + 0x0a)</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>symbol</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>saved symbol value</td></tr>
      <tr><td></td><td>...</td></tr>
      <tr><td>SP</td><td>size of bindings (= number of bindings *  4)</td></tr>
</table>

    <p>A frame is pushed by the function STACK.  It first pushes ARG,
      then the return address of the function that called STACK (which
      is extracts from the hardware stack).  It then pushes the active
      part of TVS except ARG (TVSEXT-2 bytes), leaving the stack
      pointer pointing to the copy of BINDER at the bottom.  The
      pushed value of TVSEXT will be the size of the frame above it
      (including the return address and ARG), and since BINDER is
      always zero, this correctly sets the size of the bindings to
      zero - none have been pushed yet.</p>
    
    <p>During a function call, the interpreter will call BIND to bind
      the function's arguments.  This pushes the symbol onto the
      stack (overwriting the existing binding size), followed by its
      old value, then sets the symbol to the new value.  It then
      pushes the new binding size (four more than the old one).</p>
    
    <p>When a function returns, the stack frame is popped by jumping
      to POP.  The saved bindings are undone, the saved variables and
      arguments restored, and finally control returns to the saved
      return address.  As noted above this is the return address of
      the function that called STACK, typically resulting in a return
      from EVALU.  The value of ARG is not restored - instead it
      contains the result of the function.  It is stored on the stack
      only so that the expression being evaluated can be displayed
      during a backtrace.</p>
    
    <p>As well as function calls, the reader and printer push
      stack frames as they recurse.</p>

    <h3>Running out of memory</h3>
    
    <p>If the top of the heap and the bottom of the stack meet, we
      have run out of memory.  This can happen in three circumstances:
      allocating a new object, pushing a stack frame, and pushing a
      binding.  When this happens the garbage collector is called (see
      below).  If enough space cannot be recovered, an error is
      signalled and the interpreter returns to top level.</p>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    
    <p>There are four kinds of functions: exprs, fexprs, subrs, and fsubrs.</p>
    <p>Exprs are ordinary user functions, represented by a list who car is
      lambda.  When an expr is called, its arguments are evaluated and
      placed in TVS as ARGA, ARGB, ... They are then bound
      to the symbols in the lambda-expression's argument list.</p>
    <p>Instead of a list of symbols, the definition of a fexpr has a
      single argument symbol.  It is bound to a list of the
      unevaluated arguments.  Fexprs allow new control structures to
      be implemented, for example the usual Lisp "if" could be
      implemented by a fexpr that creates and evaluates a
      corresponding "cond".</p>
    <p>Subrs are functions implemented in assembler within the interpreter.
      Like exprs, their arguments are evaluated and placed in ARGA, ARGB, ...
      where they can be accessed by the assembler code implementing the
      function.  Most of the built-in functions are subrs.</p>
    <p>Fsubrs are assembler functions that are called with a list of
      their unevaluated arguments in WSA.  They are used to implement
      the built-in control structures such as "cond" and "loop".</p>
      
      
    <h2>Eval</h2>

    <p>The function EVALU is called by the read-eval-print loop and
      by the lisp function "eval".  It takes the expression in ARG,
      evaluates it, and places the result in ARG.<p>
      
    <p>Numbers, NIL, and [f]subr objects evaluate to themselves.  Symbols
      evaluate to their values.  The interesting case is lists, that is,
      function calls.<p>

    <p>The first step in calling a function is to push a new stack
      frame by calling STACK, which provides a fresh set of workspace
      variables and space for the function's arguments.  STACK stores
      its caller's return address in the stack frame, so that when the
      frame is popped EVALU will return.</p>

    <p>Next the cdr of the expression - the list of arguments - is
      stored in the variable WSA.  Then the car of the expression is
      examined to see if it is some kind of function - a subr or
      fsubr, or a list whose car is LAMBDA (an expr or fexpr).
      Otherwise it is evaluated up to twice to try and get a function.
      The common case is that it's a symbol whose value is a function,
      but evaluating twice allows for a function that returns the name
      of a function.  If during this process it gets an integer or
      NIL, or if it does not get a function after two evaluations, an
      error is signalled.</p>

    <p>At this point, the function - [f]subr or lambda expression -
      is in ARG.</p>

    <p>In the case of a subr, the arguments in the list in WSA are now
      evaluated and their values placed in the argument array ARGA,
      ARGB...  If there are not enough an error is signalled (no error
      is signalled it there are too many).  The interpreter then jumps
      to the subr which performs the function and leaves the result in
      ARG.</p>

    <p>In the case of an fsubr, the interpreter just jumps to the
      fsubr.  The fsubr is responsible for extracting the arguments
      from WSA and evaluating them if appropriate.  It leaves its
      result in ARG.</p>

    <p>Otherwise we have a lambda expression in ARG, and the list of
      (unevaluated) arguments in WSA.  The cadr of the expression (the
      formal argument list) in placed in WSB, and the cddr (the
      function body) in WSC.  Various syntax errors may be signalled
      at this stage, for example if WSB is neither a symbol nor a
      list.</p>

    <p>If WSB contains a symbol, we have a fexpr.  The function BIND
      is called to bind the symbol to the argument list in WSA, and
      push the symbol and its old value onto the stack.  The function
      is then executed by sequentially evaluating the members of the
      body list.  The value of the last one is left in ARG as the
      result of the function.</p>
      
    <p>The last and most complicated possiblity is that WSB contains a
      list and so the function is an expr.  As with a subr, the arguments
      are evaluated and their values placed in the argument array.
      The interpreter now moves in parallel through the formal
      argument list in WSB and the argument array.  Each formal
      argument must be either a symbol or a cons representing an
      argument with a default value.  If it's a symbol BIND is called
      to bind it to the argument; if there are not enough arguments an
      error is signalled.  Otherwise it must be a cons, and if there
      are enough arguments the car of the cons is bound
      to the argument.  If there are not enough arguments, the car
      is bound to the cdr (the default value).  Again various syntax
      errors may be signalled along the way.  Once the arguments
      are bound the function is executed by evaluating the body expressions
      as in the case of a fexpr.</p>
    
    <p>Whichever kind of function was called, it ends by jumping to POP
      which pops the stack frame and returns from EVALU.</p>
      
    <h2>Garbage collection</h2>

    <p>The garbage collector compacts the heap in place, without
      changing the order of the objects.  It has four phases: marking
      the active objects, calculating the displacements, adjusting the
      pointers, and moving the objects.</p>

    <h3>Marking the active objects</h3>
    <p>In what follows I will write as if all objects were conses.  For symbols,
      read "value" for "car" and "plist" for cdr.  The basic marking algorithm is
      simple: recurse on the car and loop on the cdr, setting bits in the type
      field to indicate which have been followed:</p>
    
    <pre>
      <code>
	mark(object):
	 start:
	  if(!(object->type & car_mark))
            object->type |= car_mark
            mark(car(object))
          if(!(object->type & cdr_mark))
            object->type |= cdr_mark
            object = cdr(object)
            goto start
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>But because of the limited stack space available, recursion stops once
    a fixed depth (32) has been reached, and looping continues on the car:</p>

    <pre>
      <code>
	...
	if(!(object->type & car_mark))
          object->type |= car_mark
	  if(depth &lt; MAX_DEPTH)
            mark(car(object), depth+1)
          else
	    object = car(object)
	    goto start
         ...
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Marking starts from the registers and arguments in TVS, from all
      the pointers on the stack, and from all symbols on the heap
      unless their value is UNDEFINED and their property list NIL.
      Because of the limited stack size, there may be objects whose
      car has been followed but not their cdr.  Repeated passes are
      made over the heap starting from these half-marked objects,
      until no further unmarked objects are encountered.  At this
      point, all accessible objects have been marked.</p>

    <h3>Calculating the displacements</h3>

    <p>The heap will now consist of a mixture of marked and unmarked
      objects.  There will be a run of marked objects at the start of
      the heap (since UNDEFINED is certainly marked, as its property
      list is UNDEFINED rather than NIL), followed - assuming there is
      some garbage to be collected - by a run of unmarked objects,
      then another run of marked objects, and so on.  Each marked
      object will be moved down in the heap by an amount (its
      "displacement") equal to the total size of the unmarked objects
      below it. A consequence of this is that all the marked objects
      in a run will have the same displacement.</p>

    <p>The garbage collector now goes through the heap in order, keeping
      track of the current displacement.  When it reaches the end of
      a run of marked objects, it records their displacement in the
      body of the immediately following unmarked object (its type and
      size fields are preserved so that the heap can still be traversed).</p>

    <p>This would be sufficient to determine the displacement of any
      marked object: you could proceed through the heap from it and find
      the displacement in the first unmarked object you come to.  But
      this is very slow if runs of marked objects are long, as they
      will be as more permanent objects are compacted together.  To
      mitigate this, a table is kept recording the displacement at the
      end of each page.  While calculating the displacements, when a
      marked object includes the end of a page, its displacement is
      stored in the table.</p>

    <p>The end of the first run of marked objects, the start of
      the last one, and the displacement of that final run,
      are also recorded.</p>
    
    <h3>Adjusting the pointers</h3>

    <p>All the pointers in TVS, on the stack, and in marked objects on
      the heap are now adjusted by subtracting the displacement of the
      object pointed to.  An object's displacement is found by
      proceeding through the heap from it until either an unmarked
      object is encountered (in which case it will contain the
      displacement), or a page boundary is reached (in which case the
      table entry for the page just completed will contain the
      displacement).  As an optimization, the object's address is
      first tested to see if it is in the first run (in which case its
      displacement will be zero) or in the last run (in which case is
      will be the final displacement).

    <h3>Moving the objects</h3>

    <p>Another pass is made through the heap, again keeping track of
      the current displacement.  Each marked object is moved down by
      the current displacement.  Finally the variable AREVAL is set to
      the new top of the heap and the mark bits are cleared.</p>

    <h2>Saved images</h2>

    <p>A saved image is just a copy of the heap.  The position of the
      heap is not fixed; it depends, for example, on what file system
      is installed.  The image therefore contains addresses specific
      to the system that was running when it was saved, and these must
      be adjusted to match the position of the heap when the image is
      loaded. The addresses in the heap are (a) the addresses of other
      objects in the heap, and (b) the addresses of subrs and fsubrs.
      As mentioned above, subrs and fsubrs indirect through vectors
      stored immediately below the heap.  This means that addresses in
      the heap depend only on the location of the heap, not on the
      addresses of functions in the interpreter itself.</p>

    <p>Since the first object in the heap is the symbol UNDEFINED, and
      the value of UNDEFINED is itself, it is easy to determine the
      address from which an image was saved by examining the value
      field of the first object.  Comparing it with where it will be
      in the system loading the image gives the offset that must
      applied to all addresses in the image.</p>

    <p>The assembler code from which the Lisp ROM is built contains a
      minimal image with only the essential symbols such as NIL and
      LAMBDA, and the built-in subrs and fsubrs.  The ROM is built by
      running this system, loading in a file containing the
      definitions of defun and a few other functions, and saving an
      image.  That image is then written to the ROM in place of the
      assembler-coded image.</p>
      
    <h2>The Tube</h2>

    <p>If a second 6502 processor is connected via the Tube, the
      operating system copies the ROM to the same address (0x8000) on
      the second processor and runs it there.  The interpreter
      detects this and takes advantage of the extra memory available
      by copying itself to a higher address (0xd700).  It then needs
      to adjust all the addresses in the code, which it does by means
      of a table stored in the ROM which lists all the addresses that
      need changing.</p>
