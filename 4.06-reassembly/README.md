This directory contains the disassmebled and edited source of
Acornsoft Lisp 4.06 along with tools for building it.

The original disassembly and merging of comments from the printed
listing was done by TonyLobster:
  https://github.com/TobyLobster/lisp/tree/main/source

I have edited the code to bring it closer to the original, separated
out the heap image and tube relocation table, and provided tools to
generate them.
