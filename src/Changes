Changes in version 4.07

Changed version message to "4.07"

Bugs in zerop, onep, minusp:
 These functions tested ARG instead of ARGA.  The error didn't usually
 show up because normally ARG contain the same value, but if called
 via APPLY they would give random results.

Bug in garbage collector (1):
 If a GC occurred while a number was being allocated, the value of
 ACL would be corrupted, often resulting in the wrong value being stored
 in the number.  (The GC uses ACL for its messages.)  Fixed by pushing
 and popping ACL at the start and end of GC.

Bug in garbage collector (2):
 If a GC occurred during a call to BIND, the symbol being bound might
 move and the pointer to it in WSD would not be updated (the GC
 doesn't consider WSD).  It's likely a similar problem applied to the
 value being bound, as it was stored in the ARG array beyond TVSEXT,
 though I was not able to contruct a case where it happened.  Fixed by
 (a) adding a RESERV function to ensure enough space is available
 before using WSD so that a GC won't occur, and (b) updating TVSEXT as
 each value is added.  A better fix for (a) might be to make the GC
 handle WSD, but I don't understand it well enough to do that at
 present.

Defun didn't work to define a function called "X":
 The defun fexpr uses X as its variable, capturing uses of it in the
 defun.  This is an inherent problem with using fexprs for this sort of
 thing.  Mitigated by changing the variable name to "X_".

Bug in ASSOC:
 (assoc 'a nil) gave an error instead of returning nil.  The function
 SOCKA tests the Z flag expecting it to reflect whether the list is
 empty, but instead it depended on whether the key was nil (which
 also meant that (assoc nil ...) always returned nil).

Wrong error number for "function expected":
 There were two errors number 6 and no error number 5.  "Function expected"
 changed 5 (cf Norman/Cattell book)
